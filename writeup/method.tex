\section{Method}
\subsection{Environment}
Benchmarks for the following experiments were executed in an Ubuntu Docker container running ontop of an Intel i7 4790k at 4.4GHz with 16GB RAM. Docker was selected as the execution environment as it provides a consistent runtime environment regardless of deployment \cite{Merkel:2014:DLL:2600239.2600241}. The builtin linux time functionality was chosen to measure the elapsed real time betwen invocation and termination of each benchmark. All relevant code can be found at: \url{https://github.com/JRWu/spring2017_cs842typesystems_final}. Additionally, the docker image containing the execution environment can be sourced by using \textit{docker pull jwu424/cs842}. 

\subsection{Languages}
Three dynamically typed languages and their gradually typed counterparts were chosen for the benchmark purposes: PHP/HACK, Python/Cython, Javascript/Typescript.
