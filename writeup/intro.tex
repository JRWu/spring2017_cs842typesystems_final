\section{Introduction}
Type systems are a tradeoff between security and convenience. Dynamically typed systems are flexible enough to allow rapid implementation and deployment. However, these systems typically have some overhead for runtime checks versus their statically typed counterparts. This paper aims to investigate the  performance overhead incurred in a few impartive programming languages via simple benchmarks.
