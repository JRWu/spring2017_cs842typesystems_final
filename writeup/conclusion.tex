\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the inclusion of a type system should introduce both safety benefits and performance benefits. However, boundaries between typed and untyped code may incur significant performance penalties which prevent the end-user from efficiently implementing types. This research suggests that using gradually typed programs which are statically compiled provide the most improvements to safety and performance. Future work on interpreters or (virtual machines) are promising as dynamic types may be cacheable to improve performance to levels seen in statically compiled languages \cite{vmAlreadyKnewThat2017}.
