# Assuming docker is installed, the image can be sourced with:
docker pull jwu424/cs842


# The repository "spring2017_cs842typesystems_final" should be forked
# From the directory, the image can be built with
docker build .


# PATH_TO_REPOSITORY refers to the path on the host machine which leads to the forked repository
# To run the docker container with proper volumes mounted:
docker run --privileged -it -v PATH_TO_REPOSITORY/spring2017_cs842typesystems_final/src:/testsuite -v /:/host jwu424/cs842


# To run the benchmarks, CD into /src/PHP or /src/Python or /src/Javascript and run the command
./benchmark.sh


# This step should be run in the /src directory
# To generate the figures and tables assuming R is installed:
Rscript --vanilla generateFigures.R
